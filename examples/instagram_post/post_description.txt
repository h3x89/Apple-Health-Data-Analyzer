📊 CALCULATION DETAILS:

💻 Data from Apple Health Export
📱 Apple Watch + iPhone
📅 Custom date range

🔍 DATA ACCURACY:

👟 STEPS (XXX,XXX):
Removed steps from cycling and skating workouts to avoid double counting. Apple Watch may count false steps while driving or working at computer.

🚴 DISTANCES (XXX+XXX+XX km):
Real data from workouts (Apple Watch GPS, accuracy ~3-5m)

🔥 CALORIES (XX,XXX kcal):
Real data from energy records (accuracy ~90-95%)

⛰️ ELEVATION (X,XXX m):
Data from GPX routes (Apple Watch barometer, accuracy ~1-3m)

⚖️ WEIGHT (improvement):
Direct scale measurement - most reliable data

💡 WHY THESE CALCULATIONS:
Apple Watch counts steps even during cycling/skating. Removed these steps because distance is already measured by GPS. All data represents actual workout measurements.
